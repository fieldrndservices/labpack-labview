<a name="labpack.lvlib"></a><h1>LabPack LabVIEW Library</h1>
<p>November 2017</p>
<p>Thank you for using the LabPack LabVIEW library. LabPack is a LabVIEW library for encoding and decoding <a href="http://msgpack.org">MessagePack</a> data.</p>
<p>The following sections are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li>
<li><a href="#os">Software support</a></li>
<li><a href="#support">Contact Support</a></li>
<li><a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></li>
<li><a href="#copyright">Copyright</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="installation"></a><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>This section documents installation instructions for LabPack LabVIEW library.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the vipm package of the LabPack LabVIEW library.</li>
<li>Open it with VI Package Manager (available for free at <a href="http://www.jki.net/vipm">www.jki.net/vipm</a>) and follow on-screen instructions.</li>
<li>Restart LabVIEW.</li>
</ol>
<a name="os"></a><h2>Software Support in LabPack LabVIEW Library</h2>
<h3>Operating System Support</h3>
<p>The following operating systems are supported in the LabPack LabVIEW Library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Mac OS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Linux RT</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, this library uses a shared library to encode and decode MessagePack data. Pre-compiled shared libraries for all systems listed above are provided with the vipm at <code>&lt;LabPack Install Location&gt;\LabPack\Private</code>. Pre-compiled shared libraries for all supported operating systems and CPUs are also available at <a href="https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c/releases">https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c/releases</a>. If LabPack is used within a real-time application or executable, the appropriate shared library must be installed on the remote target system. If an absolute path to the LabPack shared library is not passed to the appropriate <code>LabPack Shared Library</code> input, then the LabPack LabVIEW library will search for the shared library in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The directory containing the executable (exe)</li>
<li>The directory containing the project file (lvproj)</li>
<li>The <code>libs</code> directory in the same parent directory containing the executable or project</li>
<li>The <code>libs/LabPack</code> directory in the same parent directory containing the excutable or project</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> directory in the same parent directory as the executable or project</li>
<li>The directory of the parent VI</li>
<li>The <code>src/LabPack/Private</code> folder where the shared library is distributed with the LabPack LabVIEW library</li>
<li>The default system location for shared objects, i.e. on Unix-like systems this would be <code>/usr/lib</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to ensure the shared library is installed and discoverable by the LabVIEW library is to include the appropriate shared library in the build specification and place it in the default support directory, i.e. <code>data</code>, as this is included in the above list of search locations.</p>
<p>The name of the shared library depends on the operating system and CPU. For Windows, the shared library is named either <code>labpack.dll</code> (for 32-bit environments) or <code>labpack-x64.dll</code> (for 64-bit environments). The shared library is named <code>liblabpack.dylib</code> for macOS, and it is named <code>liblabpack.so</code> for Linux. For NI Linux RT, the shared library is named either <code>liblabpack-rt.so</code> (for x86_64 CPUs) or <code>liblabpack-arm-rt.so</code> (for ARM CPUs).</p>
